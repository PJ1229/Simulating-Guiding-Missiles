<h1>Introduction</h1>
I wanted to create a game to simulate missile pathfinding. Players move around as a tank and try to target and shoot moving fighter jets. I chose this project to learn more about pathfinding, differential equations, and C++.<br><br>

<h1>How I built it</h1>
I programmed the software in C++ using the SFML library and developed the entire program in Visual Studio.<br><br>

For the missile pathfinding, I employed several optimization techniques. To detect obstacles, I calculated the convex hull of the obstacles using a gift wrapping algorithm. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of the obstacles, which helps prevent missiles from getting stuck in concave shapes.<br><br>

For pathfinding around obstacles, I used a method inspired by ray marching. Typically used in 3D computer graphics, ray marching helped me detect the location of obstacles in the 2D space of the missileâ€™s environment. With this information, the missile could calculate a safe path around the obstacles.<br><br>

Finally, I used differential equations to determine the missile's trajectory toward the moving target, once a clear path was found. By employing a pursuit curve, the missile follows the optimal route from its current position to the moving fighter jet.<br><br>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
I'm happy with the results of this project. I learned a lot about pathfinding, differential equations, and C++. I also improved my problem-solving skills and gained experience in game development.<br><br>

<h1>What's Next?</h1>
There are a lot of optimizations still left for this project. One big improvement would be to implement a more efficient pathfinding algorithm such as A star or Dijkstra's algorithm. However, It was still a lot of fun developing my own pathfinding algorithm.
